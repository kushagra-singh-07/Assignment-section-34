Problem 2: 
In the Palace of Numberia, there is a square chessboard filled with numbers. 
● The main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is called the Royal Path of 
Wisdom. 
● The secondary diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) is called the Royal Path 
of Power. 
● The King wants to know the magical strength of both paths by calculating: 
 The sum of the main diagonal and the sum of the secondary diagonal.


CODE :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N;
    cin >> N;

    int board[100][100];
    int sumMain = 0, sumSecondary = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            cin >> board[i][j];
            if (i == j) sumMain += board[i][j];
            if (i + j == N - 1) sumSecondary += board[i][j];
        }
    }

    cout << sumMain << " " << sumSecondary << endl;
    return 0;
}
