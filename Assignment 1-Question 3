Problem 3: 
In the Kingdom of Numberia, the Royal Mathematician discovered a strange mirror. 
 When the matrix (scoreboard) is placed in front of this mirror: 
● Every row of the matrix gets reversed. 
● The first element becomes the last, 
● The last element becomes the first, 
● And so on… 
The King, being curious, wants you to perform this magical row reversal.

CODE :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N, M;
    cin >> N >> M;

    int matrix[100][100];

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            cin >> matrix[i][j];
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = M - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            cout << matrix[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Input 
3 3 
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 
 
Output 
3 2 1 
6 5 4 
9 8 7
