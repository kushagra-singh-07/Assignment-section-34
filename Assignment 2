Problem Statement 
In the land of Matricia, the king encodes secret messages in patterns drawn on square 
grids. 
He gives you: 
1. A square matrix of size N × N, filled with numbers from 1 to N×N in row-major 
order. 
2. A character ch which can be one of the following: 
○ Z → Draw letter Z 
○ D → Draw letter D 
○ A → Draw letter A 
○ X → Draw letter X 
Your task is to: 
● Construct the pattern using matrix elements (not just 0/1). 
● Replace all non-pattern positions with 0. 
● Print the resulting matrix. 
● Print the sum of all numbers used in the pattern.

CODE :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char ch;
    int N;
    cin >> ch >> N;

    int sum = 0, val = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < N; j++, val++) {
            if ((ch == 'Z' && (i == 0 || i == N - 1 || i + j == N - 1)) ||
                (ch == 'D' && (j == 0 || j == N - 1 || i == j)) ||
                (ch == 'A' && (i == 0 || i == N - 1 || i == j)) ||
                (ch == 'X' && (i == j || i + j == N - 1))) {
                cout << val << " ";
                sum += val;
            } else {
                cout << 0 << " ";
            }
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    cout << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}

Input
Z
3

Output
1 2 3 
0 5 0 
7 8 9 
35
